# Discovery Engine

An adaptive consumer recommendation engine that personalizes content discovery across Movies, Products, and News through a unified CPU-optimized pipeline.

![Discovery Engine Dashboard](docs/demo_video.mp4/)

## What It Is & Attribution Statement

Discovery Engine is an educational and research recommendation platform demonstrating how a single engine core adapts across disparate consumer content domains.

> [!NOTE]
> **Non-Commercial Use:** This project is developed strictly for **non-commercial** educational and academic research evaluation.

## How One Engine Adapts Across Three Domains

Consumer recommendation requires fundamentally different signal semantics across content verticals:
- **Movies:** Collaborative filtering over explicit star ratings (1.0 to 5.0 stars), predicting long-tail affinities via Simple Algorithm for Recommendation (SAR).
- **Products:** Item-to-item co-occurrence over sparse e-commerce transaction histories with a bounded catalog budget.
- **Articles:** Content-based TF-IDF token modeling with exponential recency decay, overcoming extreme cold-start dynamics within a 24h freshness window.

A detailed architectural breakdown and data flow diagram are provided in [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- **Python:** 3.11 (tested on Python 3.11.7)
- **Node.js:** v22 (tested on Node v22.19.0, npm 11.12.1)
- **uv / pip:** Standard virtual environment tooling

<!-- rehearsal:start -->
<!-- QUICKSTART:START -->
```bash
# 1. Set up virtual environment and install dependencies
make setup

# 2. Fetch dataset caches (MovieLens 1M and Amazon Video Games)
make data

# 3. Train models (fast mode uses fixtures for quick verification)
make train-fast

# 4. Evaluate models and generate results report
make eval

# 5. Launch unified demo supervisor (API + frontend)
make demo
```

### PowerShell / Windows (Without Make)

```powershell
# 1. Virtual environment and dependencies
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\pip install -e backend/.[core,dev]
cd frontend; npm ci; cd ..

# 2. Fetch raw datasets
python backend/scripts/fetch_data.py

# 3. Train fast variants
python -m engine.train --type movies --fast
python -m engine.train --type products --fast
python -m engine.train --type articles --fast

# 4. Generate results report
python tools/make_results.py

# 5. Launch demo
python tools/demo.py
# (Stop running demo at any time with: python tools/demo.py --stop)
```

## Dataset Setup

The engine is evaluated across three standardized benchmark datasets:
- **Movies:** MovieLens 1M explicit rating benchmark.
- **Products:** Amazon Video Games 5-core transaction records (capped to an 8,000 item budget for memory isolation).
- **Articles:** MIND News Dataset (`MIND-small`).

Due to licensing terms, raw dataset archives are not redistributed in the repository. As detailed in [`docs/DATASETS.md`](docs/DATASETS.md), MovieLens and Amazon datasets download automatically via `backend/scripts/fetch_data.py`, while MIND requires an explicit agreement download. In `--fast` development mode, synthetic fixtures in `backend/tests/fixtures/` are used automatically.

> **Note:** Offline evaluation results do not constitute a prediction of online production performance.
<!-- GENERATED:results_summary:END -->

Offline evaluation results serve as comparative algorithmic indicators and are not a prediction of online production performance.

Detailed metric breakdowns, cold-start degradation curves, and coverage charts are compiled in [`docs/RESULTS.md`](docs/RESULTS.md).

## Testing and Verification Gates

System stability and algorithmic integrity are validated through 11 Conformance Gates (R1 to R11):
- **Continuous Integrity Check:** `python tools/check.py` runs formatting, linting, type checks, unit tests, and secret leakage audits.
- **Comprehensive Gate Audit:** `python tools/verify_all_gates.py` verifies all gates against final artifacts.
- **Conformance Documentation:** Documented status and evidence mapping are maintained in [`docs/CONFORMANCE.md`](docs/CONFORMANCE.md).

## Limitations

As documented in [`docs/DECISIONS.md`](docs/DECISIONS.md) (D-018), key boundaries include:
- **Absence of Dislike Signals:** Sub-threshold ratings (<4.0 stars) are treated as non-interactions; negative sentiment is not explicitly modeled.
- **Fixed Seed & Single Split:** Evaluations use deterministic temporal or stratified holdouts without cross-validation fold variance.
- **Catalog Capping:** Product candidate generation is restricted to an 8,000 item budget.
- **Sample Constraints:** News modeling uses the MIND-small sample rather than the full production scale corpus.
